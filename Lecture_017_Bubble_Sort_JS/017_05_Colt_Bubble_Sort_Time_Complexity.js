// In general the time complexity of bubble sort is: (n)^2


// But if the data is nearly sorted or already sorted then, 
// with this new version, with noSwaps, its more like linear time.
// Thats the BEST CASE possible: O(n)


// SO U CAN USE BUBBLE SORT ONLY IF U KNOW THAT YOUR DATA IS nearly
// sorted OR already sorted.
